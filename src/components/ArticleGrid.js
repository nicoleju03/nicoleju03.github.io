                    MongoDB, and Express to build a mobile application with resources like mental health articles, an in-app journal, 
                    and daily checkins. One of my largest tasks was implementing content bookmarking and folder organization via controller 
                    functions that interacted with the database. I integrated such functionality with the frontend, allowing users to 
                    save and organize wellness resources."
